# GHCi as a Library

## Credits

The foundation of this code are from Neil Mitchell's ghcid project (https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid). I've taken his code and made it into a library so maybe I can use it from hwide.

## Introduction

This is basically a library for a Haskell IDE that uses no fancy AST or API under the hood, only GHCi.
