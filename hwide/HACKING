# Hwide uses codemirror, but for the moment the code mirror source code has not be put under github.

1. Download code mirror, and unzip it under wwwroot/js
2. Edit index.html if you use a different version that the one referenced there.

# Hwide is based on threepenny-gui

At time of writing, a few fixes and enhancements were still in the pull request queue, so take my own version at https://github.com/JPMoresmau/threepenny-gui
